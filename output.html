        That’s not a statement on its prospects as a company, or its accomplishments. Slack, even with recent dips in its stock,\
 is a $15B company with very impressive underlying metrics. But there’s this feeling that’s hard to shake.
        If Slack won the war, and owns collaboration, why doesn’t it feel like the war is over?
        Slack was supposed to be the app that became the OS, the end of the cycle on productivity. But that hasn’t happened. How\
 should we understand what’s happening.
        Slack is ubiquitous at most companies in tech (and in many other industries as well), but it doesn’t feel like it is bec\
oming the central nervous system undergirding all the apps and workflows of its customers.
        A new generation of functional apps have risen, with messaging and collaboration built directly into them as first parti\
es. And with them it becomes increasingly clear that Slack isn’t air traffic control for every app, it’s 911 for when they fail.
        Slack is the 911 for whatever isn’t possible natively in a company’s productivity apps. And though it’s improving, there\
 are still many structural cracks. Slack is current best solution for filling these cracks. But it doesn’t fix the cracks themse\
lves, improved processes and productivity apps are needed for that.
        As the ecosystem of specialized SaaS apps and workflows continues to mature, messaging becomes a place of last resort. W\
hen things are running smoothly, work happens in the apps built to produce them. And collaboration happens within them. Going to\
 slack is increasingly a channel of last resort, for when there’s no established workflow of what to do. And as these functional\
 apps evolve, there are fewer and fewer exceptions that need Slack. In fact, a sign of a maturing company is one that progressiv\
ely removes the need to use Slack for more and more situations.
        What drives these changes in collaboration? And is there room for one app to focus entirely on collaboration–and if so, \
what should it look like?
        To understand this is to understand that there is no distinction between productivity and collaboration. But we’re only \
now fully appreciating it.
