Our own devices distract us, others’ devices spy on us, social media companies poison public discourse, new wired objects violate our privacy, and all of this contributes to a general sense of runaway change careening beyond our control. No wonder there’s a tech backlash.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">But, really, is there? There certainly has <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2018-11-01/silicon-valley-will-lose-its-dominance-in-american-identity">been</a><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0"> </em><a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/13/technology/tech-companies-social-responsibility.html?module=inline"><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">talk</em></a> of a <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/techlash-whipping-up-criticism-of-the-top-tech-companies-11547146279">backlash</a>, for a <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.axios.com/america-wakes-up-to-the-dark-side-of-the-internet-1513307266-f6ce508b-be50-4a19-92f5-f2863972a9f4.html">couple</a> of <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/12/technology/tech-giants-threats.html?_r=0&amp;module=inline">years</a> <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.axios.com/big-techs-year-of-reckoning-1540547290-4340447c-09fe-4de6-b877-7fd048b7a71d.html">now</a>. Politicians have discussed <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-global-tech-backlash-is-just-beginning-1540476151">regulating</a> big tech companies more tightly. Fines have been issued, <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/09/opinion/sunday/chris-hughes-facebook-zuckerberg.html?module=inline">breakups</a> called for. A tech press once dedicated almost exclusively to gadget lust and organizing conferences that trot out tech lords for the rest of us to worship has taken on a more critical tone; a drumbeat of exposés reveal ethically and legally dubious corporate behavior. Novels and movies paint a <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/new-novels-and-movies-ask-whos-afraid-of-the-big-bad-tech-11566379802">skeptical or even dystopian</a> picture of where tech is taking us. We all know people who have theatrically quit this or that social media service, or announced digital sabbaticals. And, of course, everybody kvetches, all the time.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">However, there is the matter of our actual behavior in the real-world marketplace. The evidence there suggests that, in fact, we love our devices as much as ever. There is no tech backlash.</p></div><aside class="css-ew4tgv"></aside></div><div class=""><div class="css-17dprlf"><iframe class="css-sqdgy8" src="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/admin/100000006451534.embedded.html?" width="100%"></iframe></div></div><div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn"><div class="css-53u6y8"><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Consider Facebook: It’s hard to imagine <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.axios.com/facebook-reputation-drops-axios-harris-poll-0d6c406a-4c2e-463a-af98-1748d3e0ab9a.html">a more backlashable company</a>. Facebook is widely associated with data breaches, the spread of dubious information and a basic deterioration of interpersonal communication. It was recently fined nearly $5 billion by the Federal Trade Commission for <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/12/technology/facebook-ftc-fine.html?module=inline">mishandling its customers’ data</a>. And, given its ubiquity, it’s also a handy stand-in for the corporatization of online life in general. If you’re going to make a show of quitting a tech service, Facebook may be your best choice.</p></div><aside class="css-ew4tgv"></aside></div><div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn"><div class="css-53u6y8"><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">But according to its most recent quarterly report, the number of Facebook accounts used daily (1.59 billion) and monthly (2.4 billion) each <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-posts-strong-earnings-revenue-growth-11563999791">increased by 8 percent over the prior quarter</a>. Despite all the anecdotes you’ve heard about people deleting their accounts, the company’s flagship app <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-stays-out-of-the-corner-11564006434">added about a million new daily users in the United States alone</a>. Revenue was up 28 percent. Even factoring in the F.T.C. fine, Facebook recorded a profit of $2.6 billion.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Facebook is not the only demonized tech platform; social media companies in general are routinely criticized as toxic swamps full of trolls, liars and bots. But again, there’s no evidence of any exodus. In the same quarter, Twitter <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/twitters-costs-rise-but-more-users-flock-to-platform-11564138836">added</a> five million new daily users, and Snap <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/snap-posts-record-user-growth-11563912652">reported</a> that the daily user base of its flagship Snapchat app grew 7 percent, its best-ever performance as a public company. According to the Pew Research Center, 72 percent of Americans <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.pewinternet.org/fact-sheet/social-media/">use</a> some form of social media, a percentage that has risen steadily for years and shows no sign of flagging. (The people I know who quit Facebook all use Facebook-owned Instagram, WhatsApp, or both.)</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">[If you’re online — and, well, you are — chances are someone is using your information. We’ll tell you what you can do about it. </em><a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/privacy-project?action=click&amp;module=inline&amp;pgtype=Article"><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">Sign up for our limited-run newsletter</em></a><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">.]</em></p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Habits <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/4/28/17293056/facebook-deletefacebook-social-network-monopoly">die hard</a>. But even more remarkable than our apparent reluctance to ditch the technologies we love to dis is a fervent embrace of newer new things that seem, at the very least, worth approaching with caution.</p></div><aside class="css-ew4tgv"></aside></div><div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn"><div class="css-53u6y8"><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Take smart speakers — the kind that respond to vocal prompts and questions — as an example. It’s exactly the sort of technology that gives people pause. Is this thing listening to me all the time? What about these weird stories of <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/my-electronic-devices-are-laughing-at-me-1521734921?mod=article_inline">smart speakers laughing</a> or <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/its-not-an-intruder-its-alexa-asserting-her-independence-1539012249">cursing</a>, or <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2018/05/24/an-amazon-echo-recorded-a-familys-conversation-then-sent-it-to-a-random-person-in-their-contacts-report-says/?noredirect=on">randomly recording a conversation and sending it to the owners’ contacts</a>? The tech press has gotten better and better at <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/21/technology/personaltech/alexa-siri-google-assistant-listen.html?module=inline">chronicling</a> the latest troubling answers — for instance, people may in fact listen to your voice activations as part of the process of refining the device’s functionality — and detailing what, if anything, you can do about it.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Nevertheless: As of last year, a little more than a quarter of American households owned a smart speaker, according to <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/08/over-a-quarter-of-u-s-adults-now-own-a-smart-speaker-typically-an-amazon-echo/">one estimate</a>. The category leader is the Amazon Echo, equipped with the Alexa voice-recognition software; Amazon says it has sold more than <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.cnet.com/news/amazon-has-sold-more-than-100-million-alexa-devices/">100 million Alexa devices</a>.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Certain tech-use indicators have in fact leveled off in recent years, but that’s mostly because they correspond with categories that are already thoroughly established and widespread: Around 95 percent of consumers in the United States say they have or use a cellphone, and 89 percent have or use the internet, <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2018/09/28/internet-social-media-use-and-device-ownership-in-u-s-have-plateaued-after-years-of-growth/">according to Pew</a>. But dig a little deeper into that data, and it turns out that “new connected devices continue to emerge” and we continue to embrace them. In addition to voice assistants, smart TVs and wearable devices are growing in popularity.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Perhaps most remarkable, if you think we’re in the midst of tech backlash, is the traction of the aggressively hyped “smart home” trend, <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/02/smarter-living/wirecutter/smart-home-safety-security-vacation.html?module=inline">encouraging</a> you to link your locks and lights and other household infrastructure to the internet. Amazon (which intuitively ought to be suffering in a tech-backlashed environment) recently <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://press.aboutamazon.com/news-releases/news-release-details/alexa-how-was-prime-day-prime-day-2019-surpassed-black-friday">announced</a> that the record sales on its most recent Prime Day promotion included “millions of smart home devices.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">A particularly striking example touted by the company: gangbuster sales of Amazon’s own Ring video doorbell system and related home surveillance and security products. Ring has <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.cnet.com/news/what-is-amazon-rekognition-facial-recognition-software/">formed partnerships</a> with <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2019/08/28/doorbell-camera-firm-ring-has-partnered-with-police-forces-extending-surveillance-reach/">hundreds</a> of <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/daveyalba/a-new-map-shows-all-the-places-where-police-have-partnered">police departments</a>, encouraging users to share video directly with law enforcement. And the device and its associated neighborhood-communiqué app have been <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.vox.com/recode/2019/7/16/20695008/amazon-ring-prime-day-fear-social-media">criticized</a> for essentially encouraging racial profiling and general paranoia. Amazon has <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://beta.washingtonpost.com/technology/2019/08/28/doorbell-camera-firm-ring-has-partnered-with-police-forces-extending-surveillance-reach/">denied</a> that Ring currently uses the company’s spookily named Rekognition facial-recognition software (which is <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.cnet.com/news/what-is-amazon-rekognition-facial-recognition-software/">used</a> by law enforcement agencies and businesses). But as reports by <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/nicolenguyen/amazon-ring-facial-recognition-ukraine">BuzzFeed</a> and <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.marketplace.org/2019/01/17/why-doorbell-video-cameras-are-raising-some-ethical-concerns/">others</a> have pointed out, the device’s terms of service allow the company to use Ring-collected recordings to help develop new products and services. It’s not hard to imagine this pointing to a future when the camera will “recognize” who your neighbors are.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">That sounds like the sort of potentially invasive and controlling technology that would spark a public <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2019/4/27/18518598/ai-facial-recognition-ban-apple-amazon-microsoft">outcry</a> — if not actual marching in the streets, then at least intense pressure on public officials to keep the tech giants in check, and on the tech giants themselves. But as with other unnerving-sounding innovations — self-driving cars, <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/big-brother-in-the-mall-11555128005">beacon devices</a> that let retailers track customers’ in-store behavior, delivery drones, cashier-less stores — we mostly just shrug. Or, as in the case of the Ring, actively participate in the aggressive spread of a technology whose potential implications are <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2019/08/dont-call-our-surveillance-products-surveillance-ring-tells-police/">unclear</a>.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">So if there is no tech backlash, why is that? Probably a combination of factors. For starters, technology can be complicated, and most of us don’t bother to read terms-of-service agreements, let alone try to understand how something like Alexa, or <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2019/01/16/percent-americans-didnt-know-facebook-collected-their-interests-target-ads-until-pew-asked-them-about-it/">even Facebook</a>, really works. By and large, tech companies prefer it this way, and they either actively obscure the way their algorithms make decisions or passively encourage you to focus on the post-user-manual idea that technology “just works,” and you don’t need to worry about whys or (especially) hows.</p></div><aside class="css-ew4tgv"></aside></div><div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn"><div class="css-53u6y8"><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Also, we really, really like<em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0"> </em>much of what technology has to offer. There are good reasons to feel that way: Technology has improved the world, and our lives, in plenty of ways. But it often seems we are willing to overlook significant potential downsides in exchange for rather trivial payoffs. Apparently, for example, the <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.cnbc.com/2018/09/10/adobe-analytics-what-people-use-amazon-echo-and-smart-speakers-for.html">main uses</a> of voice technology are ordering a speaker to play music or asking for a weather report. (Another example, in the interest of full disclosure: My deep concerns about a citizen-enabled surveillance state have not yet inspired me to ditch my own Ring doorbell.)</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Maybe being a more determined backlasher just feels hopeless. Quitting Facebook or <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://gizmodo.com/i-tried-to-block-amazon-from-my-life-it-was-impossible-1830565336">boycotting Amazon</a> seems similar to removing a drop of water from the ocean. Even an unfamiliar start-up backed with piles of venture capital has the resources to get around whatever entity is supposed to regulate it. The Luddites lost. Why not just learn to stop worrying and love the gizmos?</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">I wonder if the main reason more of us aren’t active participants in a tangible tech backlash is that we assume lots of <em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">other</em> people are. After all, the same tech lords people pay to worship at pricey conferences are now occasionally hauled before Congress, and there’s <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://morningconsult.com/2019/03/06/nearly-half-voters-support-ftc-new-task-force-examine-tech-monopolies/">some sense</a> that cracking down on them <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.vox.com/2019/6/4/18652469/washington-antitrust-regulate-amazon-google-facebook-look-at-polls">might</a> be <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.politico.com/story/2018/07/08/republicans-midterm-social-media-bias-strategy-659634">a political winner</a>.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Sure, the actual plans for doing so tend to be <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.axios.com/tech-regulators-put-to-the-test-af6a148d-169f-4563-962f-3bade47dc547.html">vague</a> (and those tech lords don’t seem to be suffering). But everybody’s complaining about technology all the time — there’s nothing more on-trend than lamenting our ephemeral hashtag culture. So it’s easy to believe that there really is a roiling tech backlash that will somehow head off any dystopian outcomes, while we lean back and ask Alexa whether it’s raining. In other words, it’s a virtual<em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0"> </em>backlash: so convincing we can really see it, if we just wear the proper goggles.</p><p class="css-jwz2nf etfikam0"><a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="http://robwalker.net/noticing/">Rob Walker</a> (<a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://twitter.com/notrobwalker">@notrobwalker</a>) is the author of “<a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/570033/the-art-of-noticing-by-rob-walker/9780525521242/">The Art of Noticing</a>,” and a columnist for <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://marker.medium.com/about">Marker</a>.</p><p class="css-jwz2nf etfikam0"><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">Like other media companies, The Times collects data on its visitors when they read stories like this one.
