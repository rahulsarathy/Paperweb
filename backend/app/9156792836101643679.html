At the end of the program, the other founders in the group voted Skysheet the third most likely to succeed. But, after Y Combinator, Bell and Gackle found it difficult to fund-raise. It was the spring of 2009, and the market was bottoming out. “We learned that fund-raising means presenting yourself as impressive, desirable, and just about to be huge, even if the person you’re talking to is so mistaken as not to invest,” Gackle recalled. (Hearing this, I thought of the rhetorical style so widely deployed on Hacker News.) “Perhaps it’s partly the Canadianness, but this does not come naturally to either Scott or me.” Eventually, they raised a hundred and eighty thousand dollars and moved back to Canada to build the software. Some of the technical challenges were more complex than they’d anticipated; there was no existing literature to guide them. As delays mounted, Gackle had panic attacks nightly.</p><p>By 2012, Skysheet had yet to launch a public product and had run out of money. Bell made the painful decision to leave the company, taking a job with a software consultancy. Gackle forged ahead. “My feeling was I would rather fail at this than succeed at anything else,” he told me. Later that year, Graham reached out with an invitation to work on Hacker News, which, at that point, had nearly two million users. “I said no, because I knew it would mean no longer being able to think about spreadsheet software all day,” Gackle said.</p><p>That August, Gackle went for a hike in the Rockies. He slipped and fell on a mountainside, tumbling downhill, bouncing off the rocks. Somehow, he rolled to a stop against a boulder. Shaken, he hiked home. “It jolted me deeply, and after that I admitted to myself that I also was out of money and needed a job,” Gackle recalled. He reached out to Graham: “I told him yes, but with a feeling of unfinished business about this technical problem, which I still carry.” He became a behind-the-scenes moderator of Hacker News. A couple of years later, he hired Bell. In a way, they were perfectly prepared. Having briefly lived the dream and failed, they would now immerse themselves in a culture in which winning—an argument, a market—is a top priority.</p><p>Gackle and Bell are the only Y Combinator employees working on the site. In addition to moderating it, they maintain its technical infrastructure. (When I mentioned, at a party, that I was writing about Hacker News, an entrepreneur blurted, “It’s the fastest Web site I use!”) They post in comment threads, defending commenters who encounter combative or aggressive behavior and content that’s been downvoted, flagged, or misunderstood; they sometimes spend hours a day e-mailing with individual users, helping them use Hacker News more conscientiously and effectively. (“Present this not primarily as a moral appeal . . . but as an intellectual one,” Gackle wrote, over e-mail, to a user who was soliciting help for a man who had recently been exonerated after eleven years in prison for a crime he did not commit. “You should frame it as a puzzle or an engineering problem. That will engage the community’s curiosity, which is your only hope for getting a real discussion going.”)</p><p>“The only way to learn it is to get it wrong, and, when you get it wrong, you get flamed,” Gackle said, in the conference room. “And you get flamed so hard that it’s like being stung by a swarm of bees. It’s sort of like operant conditioning. If you put yourself in that position, where you’re getting stung on a daily basis, you’re soon going to start learning what makes the bees less likely. . . .” he paused. “Or, actually, I like bees. I would say ‘wasps’—what makes the wasps less likely to bite you.”</p><p>“The other way to learn is to let someone else get stung first,” Bell said, quietly.</p><p class="has-dropcap has-dropcap__lead-standard-heading">In December, 2016—about a month after Donald Trump’s election—<a class="external-link" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2016/11/30/researchers-may-have-found-many-of-chinas-30-million-missing-girls/?utm_term=.6a8ddb01a670">an article</a> from the Washington <em>Post</em> hit Hacker News’ front page. The article covered a study of China’s “one child” policy, conducted by researchers at the University of Kansas and Shaanxi Normal University, that claimed that female children who were long believed to have been aborted or killed in infancy were simply not registered with the government at birth. The ensuing conversation rapidly devolved into arguments over whether or not institutional barriers exist; whether it was acceptable for users to correct the grammar of commenters whose first language was not English; whether sublimated testosterone was responsible for jihad and sexual assaults in Germany; the merits of Jill Stein; and voter fraud.</p><p>“Every single time poll restrictions have been proposed, it’s been for racist causes,” one user wrote, in response to a commenter with the username rokosbasilisk, who was advocating for a voter-identification system. “You yourself may not be a hooded member of the KKK, but you are pushing for the same things, and that’s all that matters.”</p><p>“so india wanted to voter id to prevent black people from voting?” rokosbasilisk responded. “seriously the race stuff just doesnt matter if we follow the indian model.”</p><p>“I have more faith in black people than you i guess, and think they are perfectly capable of getting an id,” a third user wrote.</p><p>“This has taken us into sociopolitical hell,” Bell posted, “and Hacker News isn’t that kind of site.” He “detached” some of the more inflammatory conversations from the main thread, hiding them from view.</p><p>That discussion, and also several others that emerged in the weeks after the election, prompted Gackle and Bell to experiment with and idea they called Political Detox Week. For seven days, political stories and threads would be considered off-topic and flagged by the moderators. The experiment was met with both relief and derision. “Political discourse is antithetical to rational, intelligent discussion,” one user wrote, in a comment that was upvoted to the top of the thread about the detox week. “Technological topics are always interesting to me . . . I love that there’s this corner of the Internet where I can participate in a reasoned, interesting technical community. Please don’t ruin it with politics, especially the polarizing American variant.”</p><p>Down the page, another user expressed disdain for the experiment. “The idea that we can carve out a space that exists outside of politics and ideology is delusional,” the user wrote. “Squelching political discussion won’t cause us all to transcend ideology, it’ll just make it impossible to discuss or critique a dominant ideology whenever one shows up in someone’s unstated assumptions.”</p><p>“Of course it’s delusional,” Gackle replied. “And still we have to moderate this site.” Three days later, he <a class="external-link" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=13131251">announced</a> that Political Detox Week would be coming to an end. They’d learned, among other things, that “it’s impossible to define ‘politics’ with any consensus because that question is itself highly political.”</p><p>The most ideologically motivated or extreme posts and comments on Hacker News—an interview piece from Quillette titled “Understanding Victimhood Culture”; a link to a video of <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/tech/annals-of-technology/how-silicon-valleys-workplace-culture-produced-james-damores-google-memo">James Damore</a> and <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/03/05/jordan-petersons-gospel-of-masculinity">Jordan Peterson</a> in conversation; one user telling another that all Jewish people should <a class="external-link" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=13056816">relocate</a> to Israel—tend to get flagged by the community or the site’s anti-abuse systems, many of which Bell and Gackle have written themselves. (Flagged posts are removed from view, though they remain searchable by URL; flagged comments are rendered in pale gray text, and only visible to logged-in users who have chosen to see “dead” comments.) Still, as an occasional reader, I have noticed certain trends. When stories that focus on structural barriers faced by women in the workplace, or on diversity in tech, or on race or masculinity—stories, admittedly, that are more intriguing to me, a person interested in the humanities, than stories on technical topics—hit the front page, users often flag them, presumably for being off topic, so fast that hardly any comments accrue. When I shared these impressions with Gackle and Bell, they looked distressed. I asked if these were problems that they felt they could, or should, be controlling or trying to change on the site.</p></div></div>
