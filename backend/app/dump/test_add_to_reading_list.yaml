        ,\"content\":\"<div class=\\\"pjgm-postcontent\\\"> <p>Slate Star Codex has\
        \ regular weekly-to-monthly meetups in a bunch of cities around the world.\
        \ Earlier this autumn, we held <a href=\\\"https://slatestarcodex.com/2019/08/28/meetups-everywhere-2019/\\\
        \">a Meetups Everywhere event</a>, hoping to promote and expand these groups.\
        \ We collected information on existing meetups, got volunteers to create new\
        \ meetups in cities that didn&#x2019;t have them already, and posted times\
        \ and dates prominently on the blog.</p>\\n<p>During late September and early\
        \ October, I traveled around the US to attend as many meetups as I could.\
        \ I hoped my presence would draw more people; I also wanted to learn more\
        \ about meetups and the community and how best to guide them. Buck Shlegeris\
        \ and a few other Bay Area effective altruists came along to meet people,\
        \ talk to them about effective altruism, and potentially nudge them into the\
        \ recruiting pipeline for EA organizations.</p>\\n<p>Lots of people asked\
        \ me how my trip was. In a word: exhausting. I got to meet a lot of people\
        \ for about three minutes each. There were a lot of really fascinating people\
        \ with knowledge of a bewildering variety of subjects, but I didn&#x2019;t\
        \ get to pick their minds anywhere as thoroughly as I would have liked. I&#x2019;m\
        \ sorry if I talked to you for three minutes, you told me about some amazing\
        \ project you were working on to clone neuroscientists or eradicate bees or\
        \ convert atmospheric CO2 into vegan meat substitutes, and I mumbled something\
        \ and walked away. You are all great and I wish I could have spent more time\
        \ with you.</p>\\n<p>I finally got to put faces to many of the names I&#x2019;ve\
        \ interacted with through the years. For example, Bryan Caplan is exactly\
        \ how you would expect, in every way. Also, in front of his office, he has\
        \ a unique painting, which he apparently got by asking a Mexican street artist\
        \ to paint an homage to <i>Lord of the Rings</i>. The artist had never heard\
        \ of it before, but Bryan described it to him very enthusiastically, and the\
        \ completely bonkers result is hanging in front of his office. This is probably\
        \ a metaphor for something.</p>\\n<p>Philadelphia hosted their meetup in a\
        \ beautiful room that looked like a Roman temple, and had miniature cheesesteaks\
        \ for everybody. Chicago held theirs in a gym; appropriate, given this blog&#x2019;s\
        \ focus on <a href=\\\"https://slatestarcodex.com/2015/06/02/and-i-show-you-how-deep-the-rabbit-hole-goes/\\\
        \">BRUTE STRENGTH</a>. Berkeley&#x2019;s was in a group house with posters\
        \ representing the <a href=\\\"http://yudkowsky.net/rational/virtues/\\\"\
        >Twelve Virtues Of Rationality</a> hanging along the staircase. In Fairbanks,\
        \ a person who had never read the blog showed up to get a story and an autograph\
        \ for his brother who did. In New York, someone brought the best bread I have\
        \ ever had, maybe the best bread <i>anyone</i> has ever had, I am so serious\
        \ about this. In Boston, the organizers set up a prediction market to determine\
        \ how many attendees they needed to plan for; they still ended up being off\
        \ by a factor of two. This is also probably a metaphor for something. If only\
        \ they had used more BRUTE STRENGTH!</p>\\n<p>Along the way, I got to see\
        \ America. Most of it I saw from an airplane window, but I still saw it. In\
        \ Portland, I ate from a makeshift food court formed by a bunch of really\
        \ good food trucks congregating in the same empty lot; one of them just sold\
        \ like a dozen different kinds of french fries. In Texas, I rode with an Uber\
        \ driver whose day job is driving mechanical bulls to parties that need mechanical\
        \ bulls, and who Ubers people around while he waits for the party to finish.\
        \ In Washington DC, I tried to see the White House, only to be thwarted by\
        \ <a href=\\\"https://apnews.com/4a50fe0b387e4948ad13ead22e75444f\\\">the\
        \ construction of a new security fence</a>; they say that before you change\
        \ the world you must change your own home, and it seems like our Wall-Builder-In-Chief\
        \ takes this seriously. In Delaware, I stood on the spot where the Swedes\
        \ first landed in America and declared it to be the colony of <a href=\\\"\
        https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Sweden\\\">New Sweden</a>; probably there\
        \ are alternate timelines out there who could appreciate this more than I\
        \ did. In New Jersey, I confirmed that the Pine Barrens are, in fact, really\
        \ creepy.</p>\\n<p>People gave me things. You are all so nice, but you also\
        \ seem to think I am about ten times more classy and fashionable than I really\
        \ am. One person gave me a beautiful record of their audiobook &#x2013; a\
        \ real, honest-to-goodness vinyl record &#x2013; as if I had any idea what\
        \ to do with it. A reader in Philadelphia gave me a beautiful glossy magazine\
        \ about Philadelphia culture, which I stared at intently for twenty minutes.\
        \ Many people gave me beautifully-bound copies of my own work, which was so\
        \ incredibly thoughtful that I feel bad that I will have to hide them in a\
        \ closet so nobody sees them and thinks I am the kind of narcissist who makes\
        \ beautifully-bound copies of my own work. The <a href=\\\"https://www.chartercitiesinstitute.org/\\\
        \">Charter Cities Institute</a> people gave me a very nice Charter Cities\
        \ Institute bag (although I assume that if I ever take it outside in Berkeley,\
        \ someone will punch me and it will start a National Conversation). I am still\
        \ really grateful to all of you. </p>\\n<p>But you already know how great\
        \ you are. Let&#x2019;s get to the statistics.</p>\\n<p>Mingyuan, the Official\
        \ SSC Meetup Coordinator, sent out a survey to get information on the meetups\
        \ we weren&#x2019;t able to visit, and determined that we had somewhere between\
        \ 81 and 111 meetups around the world. I&#x2019;m sorry I can&#x2019;t be\
        \ more precise. 111 meetups were supposed to happen, 81 organizers reported\
        \ back to Mingyuan that their meetups happened, and I&#x2019;m not sure what\
        \ happened to the other 30. Although most activity was concentrated in the\
        \ Anglosphere, there were meetups as far away as Bangalore (9 people), Tel\
        \ Aviv (25 people), Oslo (9 people), and Seoul (4 people). Medellin, Colombia\
        \ reports a one person meetup; I am sorry it sounds like you did not have\
        \ a good time. Montreal, Canada, reports a zero person meetup, which sounds\
        \ very computer-sciency, kind of like a heap of zero grains of sand.</p>\\\
        n<p><center><img src=\\\"https://slatestarcodex.com/blog_images/meetupautopsy1.png\\\
        \"></center></p>\\n<p>Here&#x2019;s the histogram of attendance, binned by\
        \ fives. About twenty meetups had 0-5 people, thirty had 5-10, and the remaining\
        \ thirty had more than 10. The best-attended meetups were Boston (140), NYC\
        \ (120), and Berkeley (105). Total meetup attendance around the world was\
        \ almost 1500 people!</p>\\n<p>Did the event fulfill its goal of bringing\
        \ more people to meetups? Many organizers had only a vague idea how many people\
        \ usually attended their meetups, and many said their city didn&#x2019;t have\
        \ a usual meetup group at all. But as best I can tell, about 2.3x as many\
        \ people attended the Meetups Everywhere meetup in a city compared to the\
        \ average previous meetup. Breaking it down by tour status, meetups on my\
        \ tour had much higher attendance (6.1x usual), but even meetups off my tour\
        \ had somewhat higher attendance (1.6x usual).</p>\\n<p>Did the event succeed\
        \ in bringing some people into meetup groups who might stay around later?\
        \ I suggested meetup organizers bring a signup sheet that people could sign\
        \ to get on a mailing list for future meetups. My data on this is sparse,\
        \ because people took the survey question overly literally and wrote things\
        \ like &#x201C;I didn&#x2019;t have a signup sheet, I just asked people for\
        \ their emails&#x201D; and then didn&#x2019;t tell me how many people gave\
        \ them. But for the 40 meetups where I have data, people on average got a\
        \ population of new signers equal to 77% of their previous regular attendance;\
        \ that is, a meetup group that usually had 100 people had 77 extra new people\
        \ sign up for their mailing last. Breaking it down by tour status, meetups\
        \ on my tour gained 170%, other meetups gained 58%.</p>\\n<p>This seems implausibly\
        \ large; did one event nearly double the attendance of SSC meetup groups around\
        \ the world? I don&#x2019;t know how many people who signed up for the mailing\
        \ list will really start attending regularly. But I will probably survey the\
        \ organizers again next year, and they might be able to help me figure out\
        \ how many people stayed around.</p>\\n<p>In total, 1,476 people attended\
        \ SSC meetups, and 339 people added their name to mailing lists (the ratio\
        \ here doesn&#x2019;t match the previous numbers because most organizers didn&#x2019;t\
        \ have a mailing list or didn&#x2019;t report mailing list data, and the ratios\
        \ above only counted those who did).</p>\\n<p>So much for the numbers. What\
        \ did I learn?</p>\\n<p>I don&#x2019;t want to generalize too much &#x2013;\
        \ I deliberately went to the biggest meetups, and things that work for a group\
        \ of 100 people might not apply to a group of 2 people. So take all of this\
        \ with a grain of salt, but:</p>\\n<p><b>1. Tables and chairs kill big meetups.</b>\
        \ Some people tried to hold meetups at a restaurant or a park with picnic\
        \ tables or something. Everyone would sit down at the table, talk to the 3-4\
        \ people in their immediate neighborhood, and that would be that. Eventually\
        \ I figured out that I need to force everyone out of the picnic tables and\
        \ into the rest of the park. This caused a phase shift from solid to gas,\
        \ with people milling about, talking to everyone, finding the conversations\
        \ that most interested them.</p>\\n<p><b>2. The welcomeness sentence is really\
        \ important.</b> In the meetup descriptions on the blog, I included a sentence\
        \ like &#x201C;Please feel free to come even if you feel awkward about it,\
        \ even if you&#x2019;re not &#x2018;the typical SSC reader&#x2019;, even if\
        \ you&#x2019;re worried people won&#x2019;t like you, etc.&#x201D; It sounds\
        \ silly, but I had <i>so many</i> people come up to me saying the only reason\
        \ they came was because of that sentence. It happened <i>again and again and\
        \ again</i>. Anybody planning any kind of meetup about anything should strongly\
        \ consider including a sentence like that (as long as it&#x2019;s true). Maybe\
        \ there are other simple hacks like this waiting to be discovered.</p>\\n<p><b>3.\
        \ Group houses are important community nuclei.</b> Obvious in retrospect,\
        \ but it was pretty stark seeing the level of community in cities that did\
        \ have rationalist group houses vs. the ones that didn&#x2019;t, even if there\
        \ were good meetup groups in both. This also came out in listening to some\
        \ people mourn the loss of the main group house in their city and talk about\
        \ all the great things they were no longer able to do. </p>\\n<p>I was thinking\
        \ of this last one because a lot of the meetups felt kind of superficial.\
        \ Everyone shows up, talks about their favorite SSC post or what their job\
        \ is or what kind of interesting thing they read recently, and then they go\
        \ home. Lots of people seemed to enjoy that, <i>I</i> enjoyed it, but seeing\
        \ the kind of really great rationalist communities in the Bay Area or Seattle\
        \ gave me a sense that more is possible. I don&#x2019;t know, maybe it&#x2019;s\
        \ not possible in cities with only 10 or 20 interested people; maybe only\
        \ places like the Bay Area and Seattle have enough people, and everywhere\
        \ it&#x2019;s possible it&#x2019;s already happening. But group houses seem\
        \ to be a big part of it.</p>\\n<p>I was also struck by the number of female\
        \ meetup organizers; the female:male ratio on the meetup organizer survey\
        \ is almost twice that on the SSC survey in general. When there were cities\
        \ that didn&#x2019;t have regular meetup groups, and I asked for a volunteer\
        \ to set one up, it was usually a woman who volunteered. </p>\\n<p>This suggests\
        \ to me that we&#x2019;re not just performing at some kind of theoretical\
        \ maximum for the amount of people and interest in a given community; there&#x2019;s\
        \ a shortage of something (speculatively, social initiative) that (in this\
        \ community) women are better than men at. I don&#x2019;t know how to solve\
        \ this (though integrating more with the EA community, which has more women,\
        \ might help), but I think it&#x2019;s an interesting problem.</p>\\n<p>And\
