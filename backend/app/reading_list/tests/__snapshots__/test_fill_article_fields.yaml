        ha hb da\">As the crypto markets continue their transition from a retail-focused,
        unrestricted global altcoin casino, to a more constrained and regulated environment,
        it&#x2019;s worth zooming out and pondering what long-term allocative outcomes
        this market is likely to witness. Cryptocurrency purports to allow commerce
        and capital to flow freely, independent of artificial nation state boundaries.
        However, when securities are involved, the state tends to intervene.</p><p
        id=\"81ae\" class=\"gq gr ar bz gs b eb gt ed gu gv gw gx gy gz ha hb da\">There
        is a good reason for this: securities are high-stakes markets governing the
        allocation of productive capital, and for them to function, the state needs
        to enforce fairness, disclosure, and information symmetry. In fact, the best
        example in favor of securities laws I can think of is the anarchy and carnage
        exhibited in the Initial Coin Offering boom in 2017. If blockchain-lubricated
        capital markets mature from these early hiccups and some of these equity-like
        assets become viable, they will surely be indexed to their local jurisdictional
        rules. To the extent that tokenization and crypto-wrapped securities become
        investable, I&#x2019;d venture that the U.S. is strongly positioned to compete
        for issuers &#x2014; despite the globalized nature of the crypto industry.</p><h2
        id=\"b3ee\" class=\"hc hd ar bz by he hf hg hh hi hj hk hl hm hn ho hp\"><strong
        class=\"bo\">What distorted maps tell us about shareholder rights</strong></h2><p
        id=\"1852\" class=\"gq gr ar bz gs b eb hq ed hr gv hs gx ht gz hu hb da\">It&#x2019;s
        often said that the SEC is &#x201C;pushing innovation abroad&#x201D; by cracking
        down on crypto projects, especially those that issue pseudo-equity in the
        form of a token. This may well be the case. It is also quite a reductive view.
        Capital clusters in jurisdictions where the rules are understood, where property
        rights are respected, and where legal systems appropriately apportion power
        between shareholders and directors. Thus, the enforcement of age-old rules
        which made the U.S. the most vibrant equity market on earth in a crypto context
        can be understood as either hostile to issuers, or accommodating to investors.
        The latter perspective is sorely neglected in the regulatory analysis.</p><p
        id=\"59d6\" class=\"gq gr ar bz gs b eb gt ed gu gv gw gx gy gz ha hb da\">In
        the issuance of equity, standardization is a godsend. If you work in startups,
        you will mostly likely have a strong understanding of the nuances of a Delaware
        C corp or the YC SAFE. When issuers select these instruments to raise capital,
        they are opting for a set of rules and a legal context which are mutually
        understood by founders, VCs, and law firms. This often entails cheaper diligence
        and less legal overhead. Indeed, some VC funds don&#x2019;t invest in anything
        other than Delaware C Corps. This is just one anecdote, but it hints at the
        bigger picture: investors like predictable and comprehensible structures.
        They like to know where they stand relative to founders, and what their recourse
        is if something goes wrong. At a global scale, small differences in jurisdictional
        predictability lead to wildly divergent outcomes.</p><p id=\"3ec3\" class=\"gq
        gr ar bz gs b eb gt ed gu gv gw gx gy gz ha hb da\">You may be surprised to
        learn that the U.S. accounts for 26% of global GDP, but a staggering 40% of
        global public equity capitalization. This point is best made visually with
        a chart called a cartogram. What a cartogram does is weight land area by some
        variable while keeping shape intact (or at least attempting to). Let&#x2019;s
        start with a basic map projection. In this case I am using the <a href=\"http://webhelp.esri.com/arcgisdesktop/9.2/index.cfm?TopicName=Plate_Carree\"

        more developed countries will swell up and less developed countries will shrink.

        the map is still intelligible.</p></div></div><div class=\"n p\"><div class=\"ac

        coded categories so you can compare similar countries by GDP. For instance,
        with this chart, you can tell that France ($2.5T), Germany ($3.6T), and India
        ($2.9T) are in a similar range. Same with South Korea ($2T), Brazil ($2T),
        and Italy ($1.9T). You can also tell that Australia, Spain, Canada, and Russia

        you might imagine it would resemble the above. More GDP, more money to invest
        in the stock market, after all. Interestingly, this isn&#x2019;t quite the

        exception, as many Chinese companies choose to list on the HKEX rather than
        in Shanghai or Shenzhen. This is partially a function of less onerous listing
        requirements in Hong Kong, partly a function of Hong Kong&#x2019;s financial
        hub status, and tighter relationships with western capital markets, and partially
        a function of the fact that Hong Kong&#x2019;s legislature, judiciary, and

        class=\"gq gr ar jz gs b eb gt ed gu gv gw gx gy gz ha hb da\">Specifically,
        there are some fundamental elements [present in Hong Kong]: a stable and sound
        legal system with strong respect of private property ownership, an absence
        of exchange rate control with the linked exchange rate, an efficient and sophisticated
        banking sector populated by some of the world&#x2019;s top banks, a simple
        and low-rate taxation regime in which there are no capital gains taxes and
        whereby income taxes are charged on a territoriality basis, and a relatively
        clean and transparent business environment intensively monitored by the government.</p></blockquote><p
        id=\"09cb\" class=\"gq gr ar bz gs b eb gt ed gu gv gw gx gy gz ha hb da\">Listings
        in Hong Kong are quite significant relative to China, totaling about US$4.3T

        gs b eb gt ed gu gv gw gx gy gz ha hb da\">Other states scoring highly on
        the per capita equity market cap figures include a smattering of haven states
        like Switzerland, Singapore, Bermuda, and Luxembourg, and developed nations
        like the U.S., Canada, the Netherlands, Norway, and Japan. Regional financial
        hubs like Qatar, the UAE, and South Africa also score well by this measure.</p><p
        id=\"b64a\" class=\"gq gr ar bz gs b eb gt ed gu gv gw gx gy gz ha hb da\">Another
        similar measure is the aggregate market cap to GDP ratio. This synthesizes

        this one better selects for nations which have a lower overall standard of
        development but still have large equity markets relative to their economies.
        Again, Hong Kong is the stark outlier here. But it&#x2019;s joined in the
        list of unexpectedly large equity markets by places like South Africa, Malaysia,
        Thailand, and Chile.</p><p id=\"39ee\" class=\"gq gr ar bz gs b eb gt ed gu

        there are only three meaningfully developed local equity markets &#x2014;
        Nigeria, South Africa, and Egypt. South Africa, a historically prosperous
        former British colony with the lingering presence of British institutions,
        is the largest of the three. Literature on equity development in Sub-Saharan

        class=\"bi gg hv hw hx hy\">IMF working paper</a> on the topic (Andrianaivo
        and Yartey 2009). The authors conclude from a cross sectional regression that
        the most important determinant of equity market development in Africa, aside
        from straightforward variables like domestic savings and per capita GDP, is
        political risk. This stands to reason: if a military junta takes over, or
        parliament is dissolved, or the country experiences armed insurrection, equity
        markets will not develop. I&#x2019;ve inserted the political risk rubric that
        the authors used to give you an idea of the relevant criteria. Historically,
        South Africa has been relatively conflict free (their main post-independence
        conflicts were minor excursions in Namibia and Angola) and has benefited from
        stable rule under the ANC, although political conditions have deteriorated
        in recent years.</p><p id=\"a1f2\" class=\"gq gr ar bz gs b eb gt ed gu gv

        development of a vibrant equity market is somewhat of an aberration. There
        are a huge number of disqualifying features &#x2014; and indeed, your typical
        state does <em class=\"jz\">not</em> in fact have a liquid domestic equity
        market. So what explains the uneven development of public equity markets around
        the world?</p><h2 id=\"8969\" class=\"hc hd ar bz by he hf hg hh hi hj hk

        dominate when it comes to the issuance of public equity? As it turns out,
        there&#x2019;s an incredibly vibrant literature motivated by this specific
        question. The foundational, field-defining paper is <strong class=\"gs ja\">Law
        and Finance </strong>by La Porta, Lopez-de-Silane, Shleifer, and Vishny.</p><p
        id=\"0287\" class=\"gq gr ar bz gs b eb gt ed gu gv gw gx gy gz ha hb da\">If
        you haven&#x2019;t read it, I strongly recommend a read. It&#x2019;s one of
        my favorite economics papers, because the methodology really is dead simple:
        the authors simply look at the variance in investor protections across a broad
        array of countries, and realize that legal traditions in those countries explain
        a significant fraction of that variance. In other words, the legal tradition
        employed on a country-by-country basis, which informs<em class=\"jz\"> what
        it means to be a shareholder.</em></p><p id=\"94a4\" class=\"gq gr ar bz gs
        b eb gt ed gu gv gw gx gy gz ha hb da\">Specifically, the authors divide commercial
        legal traditions in 49 jurisdictions into civil law and common law, further
        subdividing civil law into German, French, and Scandinavian variants. Common
        law refers to the British tradition of allowing judges to shape the law through
        precedent, whereas in civil law, inherited from the Roman tradition, the law
        is generally created by the legislature, with case law (precedent-setting
        through court cases) being secondary.</p><p id=\"0b7e\" class=\"gq gr ar bz
        gs b eb gt ed gu gv gw gx gy gz ha hb da\">As the authors (henceforth LLSV)
        note,</p><blockquote class=\"ka kb kc\"><p id=\"f9ae\" class=\"gq gr ar jz
        gs b eb gt ed gu gv gw gx gy gz ha hb da\">[Civil law] originates in Roman
        law, uses statutes and comprehensive codes as a primary means of ordering
        legal material, and relies heavily on legal scholars to ascertain and formulate
        its rules</p></blockquote><p id=\"2e85\" class=\"gq gr ar bz gs b eb gt ed
        gu gv gw gx gy gz ha hb da\">More abstractly, you can think of common law
        as a bottom-up, adaptive approach, and civil law as a top-down, more rigid
        approach. The consequential differences between jurisdictions with diverging
        legal traditions are significant; indeed, it has been <a href=\"https://www.claremont.org/crb/article/why-hasnt-brexit-happened-yet/\"
        class=\"bi gg hv hw hx hy\">compellingly argued</a> that Brexit primarily
        boils down to a dispute between legal traditions (in which the EU attempted
        to impose a civil law tradition on the common law UK, causing frictions).
        In the words of the <a href=\"https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2013/07/16/what-is-the-difference-between-common-and-civil-law\"
        class=\"bi gg hv hw hx hy\">Economist</a>, &#x201C;English lawyers take pride
        in the flexibility of their [common law] system, because it can quickly adapt
        to circumstance without the need for Parliament to enact legislation.&#x201D;
        In short, common law is considered to be faster moving and more adaptable
        &#x2014; ideal for fast-changing capital markets.</p><p id=\"cadf\" class=\"gq
        gr ar bz gs b eb gt ed gu gv gw gx gy gz ha hb da\">A full 21 countries in
        the sample inherit France&#x2019;s civil law tradition, many of which were
        conquered by Napoleon. Others were added as part of France&#x2019;s colonial
        holdings in Africa and the Pacific. And French jurisprudence informed the
        structure of post-colonial regimes in the wake of Spanish and Portuguese empires
        in Latin America.</p><p id=\"181d\" class=\"gq gr ar bz gs b eb gt ed gu gv
        gw gx gy gz ha hb da\">The British Empire led to the proliferation of English
        jurisprudence throughout the commonwealth. Strikingly, these colonial origins
        seem to have had long term effects on the future development of shareholder
        rights, hundreds of years later. As LLSV note:</p><blockquote class=\"ka kb
        kc\"><p id=\"b48e\" class=\"gq gr ar jz gs b eb gt ed gu gv gw gx gy gz ha
        hb da\">[L]aws differ a great deal across countries: an investor in France
        has very different legal rights than she does in Britain or Taiwan. Moreover,
        a large part of this variation is accounted for by differences in legal origin.
        Civil laws give investors weaker legal rights than common laws do. The most
        striking difference is between common law countries, which give both shareholders
        and creditors the &#x2014; relatively speaking &#x2014; strongest protections,
        and French civil law countries, which protect investors the least.</p></blockquote><p

        class=\"gq gr ar jz gs b eb gt ed gu gv gw gx gy gz ha hb da\">[A]long a variety
        of dimensions, common-law countries afford the best legal protections to shareholders.
        They most frequently (39 percent) allow shareholders to vote by mail, they
        never block shares for shareholder meetings, they have the highest (94 percent)
        incidence of laws protecting oppressed minorities, and they generally require
        relatively little share capital (9 percent) to call an extraordinary shareholder
        meeting. The only dimension on which common-law countries are not especially
        protective is the preemptive right to new share issues (44 percent). Still,
        the common-law countries have the highest average antidirector rights score
        (4.00) of all legal families. Many of the differences between common-law and
        civil-law countries are statistically significant. <strong class=\"gs ja\">In
        short, relative to the rest of the world, common-law countries have a package
        of laws most protective of shareholders.</strong></p></blockquote><p id=\"56eb\"
        class=\"gq gr ar bz gs b eb gt ed gu gv gw gx gy gz ha hb da\">Taking the
        analysis further, the same four authors followed their seminal paper with
        the 1997 <a href=\"https://www.nber.org/papers/w5879\" class=\"bi gg hv hw
        hx hy\">Legal Determinants of External Finance</a>, demonstrating that not
        only do common law countries systematically offer better shareholder protections,
        but that these investor protections empirically manifest in larger and more
        robust capital markets.</p><p id=\"9fca\" class=\"gq gr ar bz gs b eb gt ed
        gu gv gw gx gy gz ha hb da\">The authors summarize the key finding:</p><blockquote
        class=\"ka kb kc\"><p id=\"4fb5\" class=\"gq gr ar jz gs b eb gt ed gu gv
        gw gx gy gz ha hb da\">[T]he legal environment &#x2014; as described by both
        legal rules and their enforcement &#x2014; matters for the size and extent
        of a country&#x2019;s capital markets. Because a good legal environment protects
        the potential financiers against expropriation by entrepreneurs, it raises
        their willingness to surrender funds in exchange for securities, and hence
        expands the scope of capital markets.</p></blockquote><p id=\"2d85\" class=\"gq
        gr ar bz gs b eb gt ed gu gv gw gx gy gz ha hb da\">This might seem like a
        simple point &#x2014; more investor assurances yield more capital deployed,
        but when you reflect on the fact that these assurances trace back to the legal
        philosophy undergirding the financial system, one becomes starkly aware of
        the path dependence in capital market outcomes. Put simply: institutional
        quality dictates allocative outcomes. The U.S. isn&#x2019;t just the largest
        hub of capital formation on earth, it&#x2019;s disproportionately large. This
        system creates extreme outliers like Hong Kong, Singapore, or Luxembourg.</p><p
        id=\"a28d\" class=\"gq gr ar bz gs b eb gt ed gu gv gw gx gy gz ha hb da\">A
        related conclusion can be found in Hernando de Soto&#x2019;s book, <em class=\"jz\">The
        Mystery of Capital</em>. De Soto evaluates the relationship between property
        rights and capitalism in a large number of countries worldwide, and concludes
        that for capitalism to function properly, it must rest atop the bedrock of
        strongly codified property rights. His reasoning is as follows: the main form
        of savings for individuals worldwide is through property (in particular, real
        estate). The main way that capital formation occurs on a small scale is through
        the monetization of that property, turning it from a purely instrumental asset
        (somewhere to live) into a capital asset. One example of this would be an
        individual borrowing against their house in order to set up a small business.
        If lots of savers can mobilize the capital that they naturally accumulate,
        capitalism can flourish.</p><p id=\"5977\" class=\"gq gr ar bz gs b eb gt
        ed gu gv gw gx gy gz ha hb da\">However, as de Soto finds, a significant chunk
        of property, especially in the developing world, is poorly codified. That
        is to say, homeowners cannot prove that they hold the deed to their home (a
        deed may not exist), and they may not have a plausible path to formalizing
        their ownership. This inhibits their ability to monetize their property at
        all. Typically, this is due to a dysfunctional bureaucracy or a state apparatus
        which does not provide a means for incorporating black/grey markets into the
        formal economy. My takeaway from this remarkable book is that free market
        economies alone are not enough; they must be accompanied by a legal and bureaucratic
        apparatus which is flexible enough to enable property owners to make transition
        from <em class=\"jz\">de facto</em> to <em class=\"jz\">de jure</em>, and
        these rights must be consistently respected. For a longer take on De Soto&#x2019;s
        conclusions as applied to Bitcoin, see <a href=\"https://medium.com/u/a08e388f1686?source=post_page-----ce665def00e6----------------------\"

        gw gx gy gz ha hb da\">Cryptocurrencies, perhaps more so than any asset, mitigate
        these institutional constraints. It&#x2019;s trivial to prove to a third party
        that you own some Bitcoin; it&#x2019;s trivial to self-custody this claim,
        and settlement is physical and almost immediately final. Cryptocurrencies
        are <em class=\"jz\">monetary institutions </em>&#x2014; the protocol lays
        out a set of rules for permitted behavior, and all participants must adhere
        to them. This is what gives cryptocurrencies such remarkable global penetration:
        users mutually understand where they stand relative to the system and the
        established ruleset, and trust that no well-connected lobbyists are able to
        exert local policy on system. This is what Nick Szabo refers to as <a href=\"https://unenumerated.blogspot.com/2017/02/money-blockchains-and-social-scalability.html\"
        class=\"bi gg hv hw hx hy\">social scalability </a>&#x2014; the idea that
        a system can only scale to serve millions of disparate users if it standardizes
        behavior in a narrow domain (say, rules for what transactions are valid) while
        minimizing idiosyncrasy and obscurity (which undermine the system&#x2019;s
        credibility).</p><h2 id=\"28b5\" class=\"hc hd ar bz by he hf hg hh hi hj

        gr ar bz gs b eb hq ed hr gv hs gx ht gz hu hb da\">Within the crypto industry,
        the U.S. has a reputation for being extremely restrictive with regards to
        the issuance of new cryptoassets. Since 2017 with the infamous DAO report,
        the SEC has made it quite clear that ICOs are more often than not unregistered
        securities issuances, and that issuers should be held to the same standard
        as conventional issuers of securities. In the U.S., if you want to sell equity
        to the general public, this entails significant legal costs and a high standard
        of transparency.</p><p id=\"45cd\" class=\"gq gr ar bz gs b eb gt ed gu gv
        gw gx gy gz ha hb da\">In the crypto markets so far, virtually no issuers
        have met this conventional standard (one exception is <a href=\"https://stackstoken.com/static/offering-circular-20190711.pdf\"
        class=\"bi gg hv hw hx hy\">Blockstack</a>). Moreover, it&#x2019;s not even
        clear what information would be considered material for the issuance of a
        novel protocol or token. In <a href=\"https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3293311\"
        class=\"bi gg hv hw hx hy\">their paper</a> <em class=\"jz\">What Should Be
        Disclosed in an Initial Coin Offering?, </em>Brummer, Kiviat, and Massari
        convincingly make the case that the various disclosure frameworks in the U.S.
        poorly fit the reality of token issuance, calling for a more appropriate model
        to be devised.</p><p id=\"dff4\" class=\"gq gr ar bz gs b eb gt ed gu gv gw
        gx gy gz ha hb da\">The significant amount of teeth-gnashing within the crypto
        industry belies the reality of these markets: the vast majority of tokens
        sold to the public were entirely meritless, and carried no investor protections
        whatsoever. Even in cases where tokens purportedly held benefits relative
        to conventional issuance, with touted features like algorithmically enforced
        vesting schedules, much of the time these soft provisions were not actually
        enforced. <a href=\"https://repository.upenn.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1061&amp;context=pennwhartonppi\"
        class=\"bi gg hv hw hx hy\">Hoffman&#x2019;s</a> <em class=\"jz\">Regulating
        Initial Coin Offerings </em>takes a careful look at the promises made by promoters
        which could have been algorithmically enforced. In a survey of the top 50
        ICOs that raised significant capital in 2017, Hoffman evaluates the actual
        implementation in code of promises made to investors. These fall into three
        categories:</p><ul class><li id=\"deb7\" class=\"gq gr ar bz gs b eb gt ed
        gu gv gw gx gy gz ha hb jp jq jr\">Promises made about the restriction of
        supply</li><li id=\"ac98\" class=\"gq gr ar bz gs b eb js ed jt gv ju gx jv
        gz jw hb jp jq jr\">Promises made about vesting schedules that team members
        were subject to and restrictions on transfers</li><li id=\"f3c1\" class=\"gq
        gr ar bz gs b eb js ed jt gv ju gx jv gz jw hb jp jq jr\">Promises about surrendering
        power to modify smart contracts once deployed (many issuers claimed they would
        ultimately give up this power)</li></ul><p id=\"f0c6\" class=\"gq gr ar bz
        gs b eb gt ed gu gv gw gx gy gz ha hb da\">Unsurprisingly, the authors, by
        examining the actual code written by issuers, find overwhelming noncompliance
        with these relatively weak restrictions. So not only were issuers providing
        extremely limited assurances to buyers; <strong class=\"gs ja\"><em class=\"jz\">those
        issuers could not even adhere to their own, self-imposed standards</em></strong>!</p><p
        id=\"b016\" class=\"gq gr ar bz gs b eb gt ed gu gv gw gx gy gz ha hb da\">So
        we have a situation where the vast, vast majority of token offerings openly
        flouted the law. And <em class=\"jz\">lex cryptographia </em>was an inferior
        substitute for the law: the few assurances which could indeed be encoded into
        a smart contract were only spottily upheld. In this context, U.S. policy towards
        token issuance seems downright reasonable. Assuming that the predominant legal
        analysis of token launches (in which a single issuer sells tokens to the public)
        as unregistered securities is correct, the fact that this issuance was happening
        through a new technological medium is irrelevant.</p><p id=\"e6ca\" class=\"gq
        gr ar bz gs b eb gt ed gu gv gw gx gy gz ha hb da\">If you strip away the
        technobabble and the (generally spurious) claims of &#x201C;decentralization&#x201D;
        and &#x201C;unstoppable applications,&#x201D; you are left with the straightforward
        issuance of pseudo-equity to the general public. That anyone, even the most
        devoted crypto stalwarts, imagined securities regulators would turn a blind
        eye to this practice in perpetuity is baffling. And gradually, the SEC has
        come to reckon with this market niche. By being relatively (but not overly)
        stern, U.S. regulators are positioning themselves for a middle path. Far from
        outright banning tokens and the industry surrounding them, regulators have
        meted out a mixture of punishments. The SEC has prosecuted the very worst
        ICOs and given amnesty to others. Some academics have even <a href=\"https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3478661\"
        class=\"bi gg hv hw hx hy\">praised</a> the much-maligned SEC strategy of
        selectively enforcing the law.</p><p id=\"fd1f\" class=\"gq gr ar bz gs b
        eb gt ed gu gv gw gx gy gz ha hb da\">Reminding ourselves that the U.S. has
        a 40% share of public equity markets for a reason, the professed strategy
        of many industry participants to seek greener pastures elsewhere seems short-sighted.
        The fact that an inferior instrument (the public ICO) did not get a regulatory
        blessing does not mean that the U.S. is destined to lose its crown as the
        premier locale for capital formation. Indeed, many high profile securities
        regulators in other capital-friendly jurisdictions are falling into step with
        the U.S., as is customary. If crypto issuance is to evolve into something
        friendlier to buyers, with functional, germane disclosures, genuine algorithmically-enforced
        vesting and lockups, and perhaps other strongly codified investor protections,
        there&#x2019;s no reason that regulators wouldn&#x2019;t acknowledge this
        reality. That they haven&#x2019;t given carte blanche to these issuances is
        a reflection on the poverty of the implementations we&#x2019;ve seen so far,
        not the weakness of the idea.</p><p id=\"a745\" class=\"gq gr ar bz gs b eb
        gt ed gu gv gw gx gy gz ha hb da\">Recall, given the above, why the U.S. hosts
        a disproportionate share of public equity capital. Not only has the U.S. been
        a hegemonic power for most of the last century, but it has been politically
        stable, has not seen violent conflicts on its shores, and it boasts an accommodating
        common law regime which has manifested in strong shareholder protections.
        Additionally, it has a large middle class for which investing in equities
        is as much as pastime as it is a necessity. This affinity for active consumer
        participation in capital markets has unsurprisingly spilled over into crypto
        as well. Coinbase, the largest crypto exchange/custodian in the world (by
        far!), is an American company. The largest financialized Bitcoin product is
        the Bitcoin Investment Trust, issued by the NY-based Grayscale. The first
        established global financial institution to take Bitcoin and digital assets
        seriously was the Boston-based Fidelity. To the extent that this industry
        is an <em class=\"jz\">asset class</em> (to be clear, the jury is still out
        on this!)<em class=\"jz\">, </em>jurisdictions with the financial plumbing
        and the consumer demand for exposure will naturally be the first to service
        it.</p><p id=\"54d8\" class=\"gq gr ar bz gs b eb gt ed gu gv gw gx gy gz
        ha hb da\">This perspective may strike you as anglocentric. However, consider
        it in context. Within the crypto industry, the U.S. is considered a pariah
        simply for enforcing its local laws (and even then, extremely permissively
        &#x2014; see the Block.one settlement). The token frenzy has been chased overseas
        for now, but it&#x2019;s unlikely to develop into a functional securities
        market if it operates in an anarchic mode, dependent on the goodwill of marginal
        jurisdictions. The industry&#x2019;s best hope is to acknowledge that market
        oversight is what makes them function and embrace a regime which takes a commonsense
        view about shareholder/tokenholder protection.</p><p id=\"d8fe\" class=\"gq
        gr ar bz gs b eb gt ed gu gv gw gx gy gz ha hb da\">When and if these markets
        do mature, and security tokens, or on-chain cashflow-wrapped instruments,
        or highly automated smart-contract-mediated equity do emerge as a meaningful
        segment of the securities industry, I would fully expect U.S. regulators to
        engage productively. At that time, issuers and market participants will benefit
        from taking part in the most dynamic capital markets on earth.</p></div></div></section></div></article></div>","author":"Nic
