        and apps that infringe our trademarks to protect people from abuse. We found
        that Namecheap&#x2019;s proxy service, Whoisguard, registered or used 45 domain
        names that impersonated Facebook and our services, such as instagrambusinesshelp.com,
        facebo0k-login.com and whatsappdownload.site. We sent notices to Whoisguard
        between October 2018 and February 2020, and despite their obligation to provide
        information about these infringing domain names, they declined to cooperate.&#xA0;</span><span>&#xA0;</span></p>\n<p><span>We
