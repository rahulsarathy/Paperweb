		<p><em>The arc of collaboration is long and it bends in the direction of functional workflows. </em></p>



<p><em>Why Slack is an Else Statement, there is no distinction between productivity and collaboration, and why the Slack of Gaming may be Discord but the Discord for Enterprise is not Slack.</em></p>



<p><em>Disclaimer: I currently use every product mentioned in this post, and love all of them.* I also used to work at Greylock and helped with the investments in Discord and Figma. Thereâ€™s lots of opinions I have on both of them as well as their general spaces. But really you should talk to Dylan Field and Jason Citron. And John Lilly and Josh Elman, who led the investments in both. Because all four have shaped my thinking on productivity and collaboration significantly. And compared to the world they are still living decades in the future on how both are merging and where they are going.</em></p>



<p><em>*Except Salesforce, because I am not successful enough to need a Salesforce instance for my personal life.</em></p>
