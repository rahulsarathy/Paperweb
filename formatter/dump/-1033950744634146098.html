                                to longhauling is straight from your childhood: When a driver behaves badly, he only
                                gets one star. Within hours, Uber adjusts your fare. Their systems can do this
                                automatically because they have everything they need to calculate an “ideal” fare—start
                                point, end point, traffic conditions, and past fares. If the driver keeps scamming
                                others, he automatically gets fired.</p>
