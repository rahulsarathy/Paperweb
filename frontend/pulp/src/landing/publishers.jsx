				<h4>Paying Publishers and Blog owners</h4>
				<p>
					We want to pay publishers. For every magazine that contains
					one of your articles, you will receive a payout. Contact us
					at rahul@getpulp.io to find out more.

				<h4>Opt Out of Pulp</h4>
				<p>
					Most publishers value the increased engagement and revenue
					that Pulp brings to their content. However, if you would not
					like your articles to be printed out in Pulp magazines,
					contact us at rahul@getpulp.io so we can blacklist the
					internet domain names of your sites.
