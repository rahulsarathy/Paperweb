				We want to pay publishers. For every magazine that contains one
				of your articles, you will receive a payout. Contact us at
				rahul@getpulp.io to find out more. Most publishers value the
				increased engagement and revenue that Pulp brings to their
				content. However, if you would not like your articles to be
				printed out in Pulp magazines, contact us at rahul@getpulp.io so
				we can blacklist the internet domain names of your sites.
